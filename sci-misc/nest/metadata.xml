NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the
dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact
morphology of individual neurons. The development of NEST is coordinated by the
NEST Initiative.

NEST is ideal for networks of spiking neurons of any size, for example:
1. Models of information processing e.g. in the visual or auditory cortex of
   mammals,
2. Models of network activity dynamics, e.g. laminar cortical networks or
   balanced random networks,
3. Models of learning and plasticity.
