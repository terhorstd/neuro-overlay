C++ library implementing an API which allows large scale neuronal network
simulators to exchange data during runtime.

MUSIC allows spike events and continuous time series to be communicated between
applications in a cluster computer. The typical usage cases are connecting
models developed for different simulators and connecting a parallel simulator
to a post-processing tool.
