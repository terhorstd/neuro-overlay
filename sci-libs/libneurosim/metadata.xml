Generic support library for neuronal simulators

libneurosim is intended as a place to put standard API:s and common smaller
utility code for the computational neuroscience community.

Currently it provides the ConnectionGenerator interface.  The
ConnectionGenerator API is a standard interface supporting efficient generation
of network connectivity during model setup in neuronal network simulators. It
is intended as an abstraction isolating both sides of the API: any simulator
can use a given connection generator and a given simulator can use any library
providing the ConnectionGenerator interface. It was initially developed to
support the use of libcsa from NEST.
