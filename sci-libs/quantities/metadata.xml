  Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions of physical
  quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by various
  units, and possibly an uncertainty. Quantities builds on the popular numpy
  library and is designed to work with numpyâ€™s standard ufuncs, many of which
  are already supported.
